# WeConnect

I am building a website that connects content creators
(people with strong followings on YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram) with advertisers.
Content creators can anonymously list their metrics, target audience, goals, and other supplemental information.
Advertisers can view posts made by content creators and contact them for potential partnerships.

##Service for connecting advertisers with content creators (YT, TWTR, SC, IG)
